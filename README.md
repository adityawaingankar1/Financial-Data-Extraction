🧠 Developing Named Entity Recognition (NER) Models for Finance Data Extraction

This project focuses on building an AI-powered NER (Named Entity Recognition) system designed for the financial domain. It extracts meaningful entities such as company names, monetary values, stock prices, and financial indicators from reports, articles, and statements.

The system integrates three NLP models — spaCy, BERT/FinBERT, and LangExtract — for accurate entity and sentiment extraction.
Users can upload financial PDFs, choose models, and view interactive visualizations highlighting key entities and trends.

The frontend is built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, offering a clean and responsive dashboard interface, while the backend uses FastAPI (Python) for model inference, visualization, and data processing.

🚀 Features

PDF upload and automatic text extraction

Entity recognition using spaCy, BERT/FinBERT, and LangExtract

Interactive entity visualization and sentiment analysis

Model selection and comparison

Custom entity configuration

Responsive and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS

🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, React-PDF
Backend: Python, FastAPI
Models: spaCy | BERT/FinBERT | LangExtract
Other Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

💡 Key Outcome

An intelligent NER-based finance document analyzer that automates the extraction and visualization of financial insights, helping analysts make faster, data-driven decisions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
