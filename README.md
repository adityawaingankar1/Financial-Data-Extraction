ðŸ§  Developing Named Entity Recognition (NER) Models for Finance Data Extraction

This project focuses on building an AI-powered NER (Named Entity Recognition) system designed for the financial domain. It extracts meaningful entities such as company names, monetary values, stock prices, and financial indicators from reports, articles, and statements.

The system integrates three NLP models â€” spaCy, BERT/FinBERT, and LangExtract â€” for accurate entity and sentiment extraction.
Users can upload financial PDFs, choose models, and view interactive visualizations highlighting key entities and trends.

The frontend is built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, offering a clean and responsive dashboard interface, while the backend uses FastAPI (Python) for model inference, visualization, and data processing.
